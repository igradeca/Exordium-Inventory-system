In folder "Builds" you can find builded games for Windows and WebGL. Apk for Android is not included
because I didn't make the touch input part.

Scripts for item interaction are in Assets/Scripts/Items folder.
Scripts for equipment interaction are in Assets/Scripts/Equipment folder.
Scripts for stats and attributes are in Assets/Scripts/Stats and attributes folder.

NOTE: JsonHelper.cs script is not made by me, I found it on the internet and used it for better .json file manipulations.
